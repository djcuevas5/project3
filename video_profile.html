            <p>
                I'm into chill music a lot. This song just hits different with what I'd personally experienced in my past, making it the top of my list. The main meaning
                behind this song expresses the eternal feeling and inability to forget someone who was once an important part of one's life. It conveys fear of forgetting,
                the struggle to keep a fading memory alive, and the desperation to ask if the other person still remembers.

            <p>
                I love this pop band since 2018, and this is the first song that made me love the band. This is a powerful and emotional ballad
                that delves deep into the aftermath of a heart-wrenching breakup. The lyrics are vulnerable and introspective,
                conveying the raw feelings linked with lost love and the need for closure.

            <h3>Nobody Gets Me by SZA</h3>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7frfkBdV0-w?si=QzCRQUqAXtYjoG-R" title="YouTube video player"

            <p>
                I loved SZA during my high school years. Once she released <em>SOS</em>, this is the song that was played on repeat.
                "Nobody Gets Me" explores a past relationship filled with disappointment and heartbreak, highlighting the emotions of frustration, betrayal,
                and the desire to hold onto the familiarity of the past. Despite acknowledging the relationship's flaws, the song conveys a complex desire to hold onto the past.

            <h3>Hanggang Kailan by Orange & Lemons</h3>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HT2Tj_Jjlc8?si=EiC57hWbcyrBsmPw" title="YouTube video player"

            <p>
                This is my favorite Tagalog song at the moment. It translates to "Until When." The lyrics describe a person hopelessly in love,
                expressing the vulnerability and desperation that are sometimes connected with unrequited love,
                as well as the agony and desire that many people can relate to.

            <p>
                When I was growing up, this was the song that always played on the radio.
                "Tonight" is a poignant song that explores the emotions of love, loss, and longing after a loved one.
                It serves as a reminder of hope and consolation, addressing the human need for connection, both physical and spiritual, during challenging times.
